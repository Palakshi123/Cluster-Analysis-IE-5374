### Introduction 
In this project, I presented with a data-set that looks at various socioeconomic parameters for nearly 200 countries. We have divided our analysis on the basis of three major criterion:

#### 1. Business 
    1. Ease of doing business (using Business Tax Rate, Days to start business)

#### 2. Health 
    1. Impact of Health Expenditure as a % GDP on Infant Mortality Rate 
    2. Influence of Health Expenditure/Capita on Life Expectancy for Males and Females 

#### 3. Development of a country 
    1. GDP vs. Working class of a country (primarily the % of population between the ages of 15-64)
    2. % of Urban Population in countries vs. the mobile usage and internet usage in that country 
    3. % of population between the ages of 15-64 and the internet usage for those countries
